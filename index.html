        <div class="subheading mb-5">English MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. The major that I am studying is English. I am working towards becoming an English teacher, once I graduate.
          This goal is led by experiences and a passion for teaching and helping future generations. Some of my past experiences include volunteer work at my old high school. I worked with fifth graders by leading small groups.
          I have also helped at events for the school as I have helped with the school's Musical Theater program, Summer school, and other school activities. <br><br>

          The job that I am currently employed at is In N Out Burger. This job is very informative and can help me with my future goals as I have to show leadership, communication, multi-tasking, and collaborative skills.
          Although this job is based on food and customer service, you can continue to learn and shape those skills to further my success. Working at In N Out is a job where you are constantly learning new things and using your brain to continue to adapt the skills of that task.
          You need to be able to figure out what is needed and do it. This sense of taking action will always help in the future as you are not waiting for something to happen. Another skill is communication.
          You need to be able to communicate with your customers and ensure that you have the correct order, which is helpful in teaching as you have to be clear with your students to ensure that they are learning and on the right track.
          Another benefit from communication is how you speak to your coworkers, You need to inform them and keep them updated with the tasks that are completed and need to be started. All in all, working for this business is helpful to further develop your success in the future.<br><br>

          Since my High school graduation, I have continued to volunteer at my old high school, whether it is working with small groups, helping the teacher grade, or organizing the classroom. By continuing to volunteer, I am reminded of my goals and strive for success.
          The work that I do is extremely helpful and allows me to experience different tasks that I will need to do in the future.
